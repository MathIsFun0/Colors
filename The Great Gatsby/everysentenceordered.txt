- (100) I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and GOLD like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew.

- (141) Across the courtesy bay the WHITE palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans.

- (168) Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful RED and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay.

- (168) Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and WHITE Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay.

- (174) The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected GOLD, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.

- (213) We walked through a high hallway into a bright ROSY-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.

- (215) The windows were ajar and gleaming WHITE against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house.

- (224) They were both in WHITE and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house.

- (274) All the cars have the left rear wheel painted BLACK as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all night along the North Shore."

- (332) Her GREY sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented face.

- (350) Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out onto a ROSY-colored porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.

- (372) We all looked--the knuckle was BLACK and blue.

- (372) We all looked--the knuckle was black and BLUE.

- (382) Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their WHITE dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire.

- (406) The idea is if we don't look out the WHITE race will be--will be utterly submerged.

- (441) "Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the SILVER polisher for some people in New York that had a SILVER service for two hundred people.

- (506) There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line.

- (579) Inside, the CRIMSON room bloomed with light.

- (582) The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf YELLOW of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.

- (638) Our beautiful WHITE----"  "Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?"

- (638) Our WHITE girlhood was passed together there.

- (681) Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new RED gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard.

- (687) The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alone--fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the SILVER pepper of the stars.

- (700) Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and distinguished nothing except a single GREEN light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock.

- (719) Occasionally a line of GREY cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-GREY men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight.

- (724) But above the GREY land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.

- (726) The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are BLUE and gigantic--their retinas are one yard high.

- (727) They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous YELLOW spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose.

- (756) I followed him over a low WHITE-washed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent stare.

- (758) The only building in sight was a small block of YELLOW brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing.

- (772) When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light BLUE eyes.

- (794) Her face, above a spotted dress of dark BLUE crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering.

- (805) A WHITE ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity--except his wife, who moved close to Tom.

- (818) It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a GREY, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.

- (839) She had changed her dress to a BROWN figured muslin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York.

- (841) At the news-stand she bought a copy of "Town Tattle" and a moving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold CREAM and a small flask of perfume.

- (843) Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-colored with GREY upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine.

- (843) Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one, LAVENDER-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine.

- (853) We backed up to a GREY old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller.

- (871) He passed his hand over the BROWN wash-rag of a back.

- (880) The airedale--undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere though its feet were startlingly WHITE--changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture.

- (892) We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great flock of WHITE sheep turn the corner.

- (908) At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long WHITE cake of apartment houses.

- (947) The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty with a solid sticky bob of RED hair and a complexion powdeRED milky white.

- (947) The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky WHITE.

- (958) He had just shaved for there was a WHITE spot of lather on his cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room.

- (968) Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of CREAM colored chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room.

- (1118) The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the BLUE honey of the Mediterranean--then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room.

- (1171) Yet high over the city our line of YELLOW windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering.

- (1185) When we came into the station he was next to me and his WHITE shirt-front pressed against my arm--and so I told him I'd have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied.

- (1197) A massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a BLACK silk bow for mother's grave that'll last all summer.

- (1265) In his BLUE gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.

- (1271) On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk YELLOW bug to meet all trains.

- (1287) On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark GOLD.

- (1306) The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing YELLOW cocktail music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher.

- (1319) A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray's understudy from the "Follies."

- (1334) A chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg BLUE crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer--the honor would be entirely Gatsby's, it said, if I would attend his "little party" that night.

- (1342) Dressed up in WHITE flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn't know--though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train.

- (1372) "I remembered you lived next door to----"  She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she'd take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin YELLOW dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps.

- (1383) "You don't know who we are," said one of the girls in YELLOW, "but we met you here about a month ago."

- (1390) A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in YELLOW and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.

- (1411) It was gas BLUE with lavender beads.

- (1411) It was gas blue with LAVENDER beads.

- (1532) A pair of stage "twins"--who turned out to be the girls in YELLOW--did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls.

- (1535) The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of SILVER scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.

- (1555) We talked for a moment about some wet, GREY little villages in France.

- (1689) One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall, RED haiRED young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song.

- (1689) One of the girls in YELLOW was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song.

- (1696) The tears coursed down her cheeks--not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow BLACK rivulets.

- (1752) She was hurrying off as she talked--her BROWN hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.

- (1882) In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the WHITE chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust.

- (1971) Her GREY, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her.

- (2004) But I can still read the GREY names and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.

- (2014) And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie's wife
- (2018) He came only once, in WHITE knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden.

- (2093) It was a rich CREAM color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns.

- (2096) Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of GREEN leather conservatory we started to town.

- (2106) We hadn't reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his CARAMEL-colored suit.

- (2198) I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their CRIMSON-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.

- (2226) We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of RED-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundREDs.

- (2238) Taking a WHITE card from his wallet he waved it before the man's eyes.

- (2249) Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in WHITE heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money.

- (2260) As we crossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a WHITE chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl.

- (2313) I can't forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there.

- (2314) It was six of us at the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening.

- (2317) 'All right,' says Rosy and begins to get up and I pulled him down in his chair.  "

- (2320) 'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't you, so help me, move outside this room.'

- (2484) I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red, white and BLUE banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving way.

- (2484) I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the RED, white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving way.

- (2491) She dressed in WHITE, and had a little WHITE roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, "anyways, for an hour!"

- (2497) When I came opposite her house that morning her WHITE roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before.

- (2505) She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages.

- (2592) It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her WHITE car.

- (2657) It was dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft BLACK morning.

- (2788) This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy WHITE-washed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.

- (2794) An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt and GOLD-colored tie hurried in.

- (2794) An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, SILVER shirt and gold-colored tie hurried in.

- (2794) An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a WHITE flannel suit, silver shirt and gold-colored tie hurried in.

- (2840) Under the dripping bare LILAC trees a large open car was coming up the drive.

- (2841) Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered LAVENDER hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.

- (2849) A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of BLUE paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.

- (2961) I walked out the back way--just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before--and ran for a huge BLACK knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain.

- (2973) His children sold his house with the BLACK wreath still on the door.

- (3055) With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale GOLD odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate.

- (3070) We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and LAVENDER silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths--intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor.

- (3075) Finally we came to Gatsby's own apartment, a bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.

- (3086) His bedroom was the simplest room of all--except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull GOLD.

- (3111) While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian BLUE.

- (3111) While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in CORAL and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blue.

- (3128) "You always have a GREEN light that burns all night at the end of your dock."

- (3136) Now it was again a GREEN light on a dock.

- (3173) The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a PINK and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.

- (3176) "Look at that," she whispered, and then after a moment: "I'd like to just get one of those PINK clouds and put you in it and push you around."

- (3203) The GREY windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.

- (3293) It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn GREEN jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.

- (3311) His BROWN, hardening body lived naturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days.

- (3337) Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada SILVER fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventy-five.

- (3353) A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a BLUE coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting cap.

- (3353) A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair of WHITE duck trousers and a yachting cap.

- (3367) I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a GREY, florid man with a hard empty face--the pioneer debauchee who during one phase of American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon.

- (3400) They were a party of three on horseback--Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a BROWN riding habit who had been there previously.

- (3535) Or present a GREEN card.

- (3536) I'm giving out GREEN----"  "Look around," suggested Gatsby.

- (3549) Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a WHITE plum tree.

- (3568) "I liked that man--what was his name?--with the sort of BLUE nose."

- (3588) "Go ahead," answered Daisy genially, "And if you want to take down any addresses here's my little GOLD pencil.

- (3628) They were still under the WHITE plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between.

- (3667) A breeze stirred the GREY haze of Daisy's fur collar.

- (3713) Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the BLACK beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guest rooms overhead.

- (3764) One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was WHITE with moonlight.

- (3776) His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's WHITE face came up to his own.

- (3858) The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her WHITE shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry.

- (3900) Jordan's fingers, powdered white over their TAN, rested for a moment in mine.

- (3900) Jordan's fingers, powdered WHITE over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.

- (3908) Gatsby stood in the center of the CRIMSON carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes.

- (3966) Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small WHITE neck.

- (3970) "Aunt Jordan's got on a WHITE dress too."

- (4006) On the GREEN Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.

- (4015) Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the BLUE cool limit of the sky.

- (4015) Slowly the WHITE wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky.

- (4081) A SILVER curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky.

- (4112) High in a WHITE palace the king's daughter, the golden girl.

- (4116) Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like SILVER idols, weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.

- (4116) Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down their own WHITE dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.

- (4119) He felt the hot, GREEN leather of the seat.

- (4181) He wears a PINK suit."

- (4222) In the sunlight his face was GREEN.

- (4231) "It's a nice YELLOW one," said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.

- (4297) Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing BLUE coupé.

- (4491) Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between BLACK and white."

- (4491) Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and WHITE."

- (4499) "We're all WHITE here," murmured Jordan.

- (4785) Michaelis wasn't even sure of its color--he told the first policeman that it was light GREEN.

- (4819) He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a YELLOW light in a swinging wire basket overhead.

- (4884) "It was a YELLOW car," he said, "big YELLOW car.

- (4913) That YELLOW car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine, do you hear?

- (4923) It was a YELLOW car."

- (4930) "It's a BLUE car, a coupé."

- (5001) I must have felt pretty weird by that time because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his PINK suit under the moon.

- (5075) I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the PINK glow from Daisy's room on the second floor.

- (5171) There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in LAVENDER but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining motor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered.

- (5210) She had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like SILVER, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.

- (5251) All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the "Beale Street Blues" while a hundred pairs of golden and SILVER slippers shuffled the shining dust.

- (5253) At the GREY tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.

- (5274) It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning, GOLD turning light.

- (5274) It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with GREY turning, gold turning light.

- (5276) The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the BLUE leaves.

- (5301) He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her WHITE car.

- (5313) Then out into the spring fields, where a YELLOW trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.

- (5370) His gorgeous PINK rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the white steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home three months before.

- (5370) His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the WHITE steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home three months before.

- (5388) Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a GREEN golf links had come sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.

- (5455) About three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering changed--he grew quieter and began to talk about the YELLOW car.

- (5456) He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the YELLOW car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.

- (5473) The hard BROWN beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn't stopped a few hours before.

- (5503) There was nothing in it but a small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided SILVER.

- (5562) He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a BLUE quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn't far off.

- (5564) About five o'clock it was BLUE enough outside to snap off the light.

- (5567) Wilson's glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small GREY clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.

- (5602) The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he "had a way of finding out," supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a YELLOW car.

- (5649) The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin RED circle in the water.

- (5800) His eyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse GREY beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat.

- (5916) But when I'd shouted "Hello" several times in vain an argument broke out behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with BLACK hostile eyes.

- (6087) About five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate--first a motor hearse, horribly BLACK and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and, a little later, four or five servants and the postman from West Egg in Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin.

- (6133) and the long GREEN tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands.

- (6134) And last the murky YELLOW cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.

- (6164) In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a WHITE evening dress.

- (6172) So when the BLUE smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.

- (6184) She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the same BROWN tint as the fingerless glove on her knee.

- (6287) On the WHITE steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone.

- (6294) And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, GREEN breast of the new world.

- (6304) And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the GREEN light at the end of Daisy's dock.

- (6306) He had come a long way to this BLUE lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.

- (6312) Gatsby believed in the GREEN light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.
