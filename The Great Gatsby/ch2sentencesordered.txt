- (105) It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a GRAY, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.

- (126) She had changed her dress to a BROWN figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York.

- (130) Up-stairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-colored with GRAY upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine.

- (404) The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the BLUE honey of the Mediterranean--then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room.
