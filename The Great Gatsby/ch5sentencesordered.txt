- (155) Under the dripping bare LILAC trees a large open car was coming up the drive.

- (156) Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered LAVENDER hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.

- (164) A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of BLUE paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.

- (276) I walked out the back way--just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before--and ran for a huge BLACK knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain.

- (288) His children sold his house with the BLACK wreath still on the door.

- (370) With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale GOLD odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate.

- (385) We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and LAVENDER silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths--intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor.

- (443) "You always have a GREEN light that burns all night at the end of your dock."

- (451) Now it was again a GREEN light on a dock.

- (488) The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a PINK and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.

- (491) "Look at that," she whispered, and then after a moment: "I'd like to just get one of those PINK clouds and put you in it and push you around."

- (518) The GREY windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.
